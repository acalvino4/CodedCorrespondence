So if we want to code the message \"barryisthespy\" our _keyword phrase_ is \"dogdogdogdogd\". Now we are ready to start coding our message. We shift the each letter of our message by the place value of the corresponding letter in the keyword phrase, assuming that \"a\" has a place value of 0, \"b\" has a place value of 1, and so forth.
